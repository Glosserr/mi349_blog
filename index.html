        <p>Carnivorous plants like Sarracenia (pitcher plants) and Venus flytraps are fascinating species found in specific regions of the U.S., particularly in nutrient-poor, acidic environments like bogs and wetlands.</p>
        <p>Sarracenia species, especially the northern pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea), are prevalent in Michigan and other parts of North America. These plants lure insects with sweet nectar and bright colors. Once an insect enters the plant's "pitcher," downward-pointing hairs and a slippery interior prevent its escape.The insect eventually falls into a pool of digestive fluids at the bottom, where it is broken down to provide nutrients that the plant cannot obtain from the poor soil.</p>
        <p>The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula), while not native to Michigan, is one of the most iconic carnivorous plants in the United States, naturally occurring in the Carolinas. It has specialized "snap traps" formed by two lobes that close when sensitive trigger hairs are touched. This rapid movement, rare among plants, captures the insect, which is then digested by enzymes secreted by the plant. The flytrap is highly specialized for capturing and digesting insects to compensate for the lack of nutrients in its natural habitat</p>
        <p>These plants thrive in nutrient-poor environments, relying on their carnivorous adaptations for survival, and can be observed in many parts of the US if you look hard enough!</p>

        <h2>MHacks Hackathon!</h2>

        <p>At MHACKS 2024, the University of Michigan's renowned hackathon, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse group of talented developers and innovators. Sponsored by prestigious tech giants like Intel and Google, the event offered an exciting platform for creativity and problem-solving. Our team worked on VelocIT, a career fair networking app aimed at bridging the gap between students and employers. We submitted the app under the interactive media category.</p>
        <p>VelocIT was designed to enhance career fairs by making the networking process more efficient and balanced. Unlike traditional career fair apps, VelocIT aimed to prioritize students equally with employers, ensuring better interaction and opportunities for both parties. Despite the hard work and innovative features we built, we did not win a prize. However, the experience was invaluableâ€”working alongside brilliant minds in a fast-paced environment helped us develop crucial skills.</p>
        <p>Looking forward, VelocIT has great potential. I plan to explore its use at Michigan State University, where it could serve as a premier tool for our own career fairs. By empowering students to connect with employers on an equal footing, VelocIT could revolutionize how career fairs operate at MSU and beyond!</p>
