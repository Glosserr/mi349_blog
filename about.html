      <img src="/Imgs/Chill_Work.jfif" alt="Author's Picture">
      <p>Hello! I'm Joey Glosser, a passionate web developer, computer scientist, and carnivorous plant hobbyist.</p>
      <p>With 5 years in computer science related fields, I've had the privilege of working on all of my interests as I have happened upon them.</p>
      <p>Since quarantine I have had learned game development, app development, cybersecurity and of course web design. With these areas in mind, my skills include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</li>
        <li>Back-end development (Node.js, Python)</li>
        <li>Games Codebase Development (C#, Unity, Unreal)</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity Progams Developer (Python, C++, SQL)</li>
        <li>Mobile app development (React Native)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When I taking a break from software design, I tend to my carnivorous plants, read manga, watch anime, and work on 3D modelling for 3D printing.</p>
      <p>I believe in lifelong learning and am always excited to take on new challenges and opportunities in the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
      <p>Through this blog, I hope to share my experiences, and insights with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts. With a bit of a mix between the tech space, and that of carnivorous and exotic horticulture!</p>
